# Vite Example

This directory is a brief example of a Vite/Vue.js site that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.

While this project uses Vue.js, Vite supports many popular JS frameworks. See all the supported frameworks here: https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Vite project with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/vite&template=vite)

### How We Created This Example

To get started with Vue.js deployed with Vercel, you can use Vite (https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ yarn create @vitejs/app
```

### Deploying From Your Terminal

You can deploy your new Vite project with a single command from your terminal using [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download):

```shell
$ vercel
```
